1.  Clone the github tree to get the source code:

git clone https://github.com/nihilocoin/nihilo-pos Nihilo

2.  Download and install MacPorts from http://www.macports.org/

2a. (for 10.7 Lion)
    Edit /opt/local/etc/macports/macports.conf and uncomment "build_arch i386"

3.  Install dependencies from MacPorts

sudo port install boost db48 openssl miniupnpc

Optionally install qrencode (and set USE_QRCODE=1):
sudo port install qrencode

cd Nihilo/src
make -f makefile.osx

Run:
  ./nihilod --help  # for a list of command-line options.
Run
  ./nihilod -daemon # to start the Nihilo daemon.
Run
  ./nihilod help # When the daemon is running, to get a list of RPC commands
